I developed a web-based application using C#, .NET Core, and RESTful APIs with a MySQL database following a Database-First approach. 
The project is structured with clean architecture principles, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

Technology Stack: 
Backend: .NET Core Web API (C#)
Database: MySQL (Database-First approach with Entity Framework Core)
API Design: RESTful APIs for client-server communication

Key Features: 
Implemented CRUD operations on core entities directly mapped from MySQL database.
Followed Database-First approach, where the database schema was designed first and entity classes were auto-generated using Entity Framework Core scaffolding.
Developed RESTful APIs for seamless integration with frontend or third-party applications.
Handled data validation, exception handling, and proper API response formatting (status codes, messages, JSON output).
Implemented dependency injection for better modularity and testability.
Used Repository & Service layer patterns for cleaner code organization.

Benefits/Outcome: 
The project demonstrates strong API development skills with .NET Core.
Showcases the ability to design scalable, database-driven applications.
Provides a reusable backend service layer that can be easily extended with new features or connected to multiple client applications.
